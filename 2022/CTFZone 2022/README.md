# CTFZone 2022

A 48h CTF Organized by BIZone which took place on August 24â€“26.

I played as a member of Soteria Team & together, we ranked 22th out of more than 1000 teams.

For this CTF, I've played pwn challenges & they were pretty tough. I've searched & learnt new stuff when dealing with these challenges therefore I really enjoyed this one. I've managed to solve 3 challeges & made progress in the fourth challenge (`stringi`) but I didn't manage to solve it. My favorite challenge for this CTF was [microp](#pwn3 "Writeup"), feel free to check the writeup for more details!
