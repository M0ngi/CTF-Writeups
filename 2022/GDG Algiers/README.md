# GDG Algiers

This was an unofficial participation for my team & despite being a day behind, we ranked 14th out of more than 700 teams.

For this one, I focused on *Jail* & *PWN*. I solved 3 jails & 4 pwn challenges, 1 was after the end of the CTF.

I did enjoy 3 challenges in this CTF, which encouraged me to work on a detailed writeup for the solves. These challenges are:

* Kevin Higgs: The Revenge (PyJail)
* Notes keeper (Pwn)
* Faster python (Pwn)

Hope you enjoy this & feel free to contact me for questions, fixes...
