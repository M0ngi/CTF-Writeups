# Hackfest Qualification CTF

[Hackfest](https://hackfest.tn/) is a local CTF competition, this year is the 7th edition. I had the chance to participate as a member of PCP_F0rt team. Shoutouts to my team mates, Med Ali Ouachani, Yassine Belkhadem, Yassine Belarbi. We secured the first place in the qualification CTF & we'll be participating in finals.

I'll share the solvers for 2 pwn challenges, I'll make a writeup if I get enough time. (I doubt)
